    <p class="title">This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look
        happy, but he's
        a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
    </p>

    <p class="title">Jack would really like...</p>
    <ul class="title">
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
        <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="title">You can get all this (and more) at an online store. Two very popular ones are
